# --- Java 21 upgrade guidance -------------------------------------------------
# This project targets Java 21 for compilation via Gradle toolchains (see
# `android/app/build.gradle` which already requests JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)).
#
# Gradle can be instructed to use a specific installed JDK by setting
# `org.gradle.java.home` to the absolute path of a JDK installation. Replace the
# example path below with your local JDK 21 installation if you want Gradle to
# always run on JDK 21 on this machine. Keep this commented so it doesn't
# accidentally force an absolute path in other developer machines.
#
# Example (UNCOMMENT and set your local path to use):
# org.gradle.java.home=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-21.jdk/Contents/Home
#
# Alternatively, set JAVA_HOME in your shell before running Gradle:
# export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21)
#
# See docs/JDK21_UPGRADE.md for full macOS (zsh) install & verification steps.
